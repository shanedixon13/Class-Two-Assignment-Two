    <h1>Growing Up</h1>
    <p>Shane was born on May 16, 1995 to Ron and Tina Dixon in <em>Los Alamitos, California</em>. He spent the first six
        years of his life in <em>Orange County, California</em> before he and his family moved to <em>Malvern,
            Arkansas</em>. Like most kids in small towns, he spent most of his time outdoors with friends doing a
        variety of things from fishing to four-wheeler riding. He attended <b>Malvern High School</b> and during his
        time there shifted gears from the traditional college approach he had grown to accept as his future after
        meeting a Marine Corps Recruiter during a presentation. </p>
    <br>

    <h1>Marine Corps</h1>
    <p>Shane enlisted in the Marine Corps in May of 2012, when he was 17 years old and attended recruit training at
        <b>MCRD San Diego</b> beginning in May of 2013. Following that he went to several different schools to hone the
        basic skills necessary to be a KC-130J Crewmaster. It was at one of these schools that he met his future wife,
        Meghan. He was then stationed at <b>MCAS Miramar</b> in <em>San Diego, California</em>. Once qualified he spent
        the next five years polishing the previously learned skills while gaining more qualifications. His duties ranged
        from preflight and postflight checks, to cargo loading and in flight systems management. In the years to come,
        he would become a Level-One Plane Captain, Engine-Run Technician, and an instructor. Due to the nature of his
        career, he traveled all over the US and the world to carry cargo and troops and to deliver fuel. His son,
        Patton, was born just before his first deployment on May 20, 2016. Shane would continue to serve until the end
        of his contract in May of 2018 when he decided to not re-enlist and to, instead, focus on getting more time with
        family.
    </p>

    <h1>Career Searching After the Corps</h1>
    <p>One issue that Shane ran into upon leaving the Marine Corps, is that his set of skill are not in high demand in
        all areas. Fortunately, he met a recruiter from <b>JB Hunt</b> during a job fair that was part of a transition
        course. He was informed that their program partnered with the GI Bill to provide a solid working opportunity.
        This led Shane to enroll in a trucking school in <em>Springdale, Arkansas</em> immediately after moving back to
        Arkansas. After this he worked as a Final Mile delivery driver across the state of Arkansas to deliver Whirlpool
        products to businesses. Due to safety concerns he moved on to another position as a CDL Driver and Aerial
        Technician for a telecommunications contracting company. Unfortunately, yet again, safety concerns led to
        another shift in work. The next stop was at <b>ABF Freight</b> as a local worker, where he spent most of his
        time for a year and a half working at a distribution center in <em>North Little Rock, Arkansas</em> as a
        forklift operator and in the yard working with trailer movement and hookups. Due to health issues he had to give
        up CDL driving, at least for the time, and look for a new opportunity. After trying his hand at insurance sales,
        he decided to go back to his love of computers and do hardware repair before moving onto then pursue a career in
        software development. </p>
